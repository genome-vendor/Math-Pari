=====>>> BETA level interface to version 2.0 <<<=======

a) Should be installed inside or near pari-2.* source directory.
b) Patches to PARI (in `patches') should be applied.
c) paricfg.h should be created beforehand in pari-2,* build directory
	(run configure to do this).
d) We skip "compatibility" tests, and do not support "compatibility" mode.

================================================================
Next paragraph is an excerpt from documentation inside Pari.pm:

  Package Math::Pari is a Perl interface to famous library PARI for
  numerical/scientific/number-theoretic calculations.  It allows use of
  most PARI functions (>500) as Perl functions, and (almost) seamless merging
  of PARI and Perl data. 

Documentation to this package is contained inside Pari.pm. After
installing it is accessible by standard means, like

  perldoc Math::Pari
  man Math::Pari

and possibly in other forms particular for your system.

A copy of documentation of the PARI library in POD format is provided as 
well, access it as Math::libPARI:

  perldoc Math::libPARI
  man Math::libPARI

For long instructions to install Math::Pari see file INSTALL.  Short
instructions work if you have PARI build directory, or have Net::FTP

  a) Get the latest beta version of Math::Pari.  Note that CPAN.pm will
     not autofetch beta versions of modules, so you need to fetch it
     as a distribution if you want to use CPAN.pm, similar to

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	CPAN> d Math::Pari
	CPAN> test ILYAZ/modules/Math-Pari-2.0011_03.tar.gz

     or manually FTP the file, extract it, and try to build

        tar -zxfv Math-Pari-2.0011_03.tar.gz
	cd Math-Pari-2.0011_03
	perl Makefile.PL
	make test

  b) If the necessary patches were not applied to the latest version
     of PARI yet, you need to manually apply the patches (see INSTALL)
     in the build directory after "make test" fails, and redo

	make test

  c)	make install

     will finish the installation

(lowercase test scripts translate native PARI tests from GP syntax to
Perl syntax.  You can get a better understanding of these translations
by running the tests manually, as in

	perl t/all.t

after install, or

	perl -Mblib t/all.t

before install.)

The version 2.0011_00 was tested with OS/2 and Solaris.  It was tested
with the patched version 2.0.11 of the PARI library.
