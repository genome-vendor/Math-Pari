=====>>> BETA level interface to version 2.0 <<<=======

a) Should be installed inside or near pari-2.* source directory.
b) Patches to PARI (in `patches') should be applied.
c) paricfg.h should be created beforehand in pari-2,* build directory
	(run configure to do this).
d) We skip "compatibility" tests, and do not support "compatibility" mode.

================================================================
Next paragraph is an excerpt from documentation inside Pari.pm:

  Package Math::Pari is a Perl interface to famous library PARI for
  numerical/scientific/number-theoretic calculations.  It allows use of
  most PARI functions (>500) as Perl functions, and (almost) seamless merging
  of PARI and Perl data. 

Documentation to this package is contained inside Pari.pm. After
installing it is accessible by standard means, like

  perldoc Math::Pari
  man Math::Pari

and possibly in other forms particular for your system.

A copy of documentation of the PARI library in POD format is provided as 
well, access it as Math::libPARI:

  perldoc Math::libPARI
  man Math::libPARI

If you have a not very old perl (5.003 should do), then

  a) Get the latest PARI distribution from
	ftp://megrez.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/unix/

  b) uncompress the distribution and run 'Configure' script
	sh ./Configure

  c) It is not required to make PARI, but you can do it nevertheless:
	make test
     in toplevel PARI directory;

  d) uncompress the Math::Pari archive into a separate directory (for
     best results make it a subdirectory of PARI's root directory);

  e) Apply patches from patches subdirectory of Math::Pari (patches
     are made for PARI 2.0.11.beta, your mileage may vary);

  f) _Optionally_ find the architecture of your processor (if it is not
     known/supported and recognized automatically, the slower 'port' code
     without assembler should be used).  Recognized "processors" are 

	sun3 sparcv7 sparcv8micro sparcv8super alpha hppa i386 port

     the current version should autorecognize them in most situations;

  g) do

	perl Makefile.PL 
		or
	perl Makefile.PL machine=hppa
     then

	make
	make test

     (expect several failures from t/*_will_fail.t, but other tests should
     pass). 

  h) Now

	make install

     should make this extension available to the perl programs.

(lowercase test scripts translate native PARI tests from GP syntax to
Perl syntax.  You can get a better understanding of these translations
by running the tests manually, as in

	perl t/all.t

after install, or

	perl -Mblib t/all.t

before install.)

The version 2.0011_00 was tested with OS/2 and Solaris.  It was tested
with the patched version 2.0.11 of the PARI library.
