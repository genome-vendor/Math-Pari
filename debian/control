Description: Perl interface to PARI.
 This package is a Perl interface to famous library PARI for
 numerical/scientific/number-theoretic calculations. It allows use of most
 PARI functions as Perl functions, and (almost) seamless merging of PARI and
 Perl data. In what follows we suppose prior knowledge of what PARI is (see
 ftp://megrez.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari, or Math::libPARI).
